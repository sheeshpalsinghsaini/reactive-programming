## Transformation Operators for Mono

### Mono Transformation Operators 

### 01. map

     It allows you to apply a function to the item emitted by a Mono, transforming it into a new value. The map operator is used to synchronously transform the data within the reactive stream.

    What Does map Do?
        The map operator applies a given function to the item emitted by the Mono and returns a new Mono that emits the transformed item.
        The transformation happens on the item itself, and it’s done synchronously—meaning that the transformation happens immediately as the item is emitted.

    Why Use map?
        Data Transformation: map is typically used when you need to convert or modify the data emitted by a Mono. For example, you might use map to convert an object into a different type, perform calculations, or apply some logic to the data.
        Chaining Operations: map is often used in a chain of operations to build a sequence of transformations on the data before it’s finally consumed.
        Simplification: It allows you to handle data transformations within the reactive stream itself, keeping your code concise and declarative.
-------
    Mono<String> originalMono = Mono.just("hello");
    Mono<String> upperMono = originalMono.map(String::toUpperCase);

    upperMono.subscribe(
        value -> System.out.println("Transformed Value: " + value),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );

    Key Points
        Synchronous Transformation: The transformation happens synchronously, meaning the map function is applied immediately when the Mono emits the item.
        Single Item Transformation: map operates on the single item emitted by the Mono. If you have a Mono that emits a more complex object, you can use map to transform it into a different object or value.
        Non-blocking: Like all operators in Project Reactor, map is non-blocking. The transformation itself should not introduce blocking behavior.


### 2. flatMap() 

    It is used to asynchronously transform the value emitted by a Mono into another Mono, effectively "flattening" the nested structure of reactive types. This is particularly useful when the transformation itself returns a Mono.
    
Note flattening: process of converting a nested structure into a simpler, single-level structure like Mono<Mono<String>> -> Mono<String> 

    What Does flatMap() Do?
        Asynchronous Transformation: The flatMap() operator takes a function that returns a Mono (or Publisher). When a Mono emits a value, flatMap() applies the provided function to that value, and instead of wrapping the resulting Mono in another Mono, it "flattens" the result so that the output is a single Mono.
        Non-blocking: flatMap() allows you to perform non-blocking, asynchronous operations, making it suitable for scenarios where the transformation involves I/O operations, such as calling an external service, database query, or any other asynchronous task.

    Why Use flatMap()?
        Chaining Asynchronous Calls: When you need to perform an asynchronous operation based on the result of another operation, flatMap() is the go-to operator.
        Avoiding Nested Monos: Instead of ending up with a Mono<Mono<T>>, which is cumbersome to work with, flatMap() allows you to work with a simple Mono<T> by flattening the structure.
        Composing Reactive Streams: flatMap() is ideal for composing complex reactive streams where each step may involve an asynchronous operation that returns another Mono

    Example

Suppose you have two methods:

    fetchUserId(String username): returns a Mono<Integer> that emits a user ID.
    fetchUserDetails(Integer userId): returns a Mono<User> that emits user details based on the user ID.

    You want to get the user details for a given username. Here’s how you might do it:


    Mono<User> userMono = fetchUserId("john_doe")
    .flatMap(userId -> fetchUserDetails(userId));

    How It Works
        Step 1: fetchUserId("john_doe") returns a Mono<Integer> that emits the user ID.
        Step 2: flatMap(userId -> fetchUserDetails(userId)) takes the emitted user ID and applies the fetchUserDetails function, which returns a Mono<User>.
        Step 3: Instead of getting a Mono<Mono<User>>, flatMap() flattens this into a Mono<User>.

    Key Points
        Flattening: flatMap() flattens the result from a Mono<Mono<T>> to a Mono<T>, making it easier to work with.
        Asynchronous Operations: It is commonly used when the transformation involves asynchronous operations that return a Mono.
        Error Handling: If an error occurs in any of the Monos, the error will be propagated down the stream, allowing for centralized error handling



    Comparison with map()
        map(): Transforms the item emitted by the Mono into another item. It is synchronous and returns a Mono<T> from a Mono<T>.
        flatMap(): Transforms the item into another Mono. It is asynchronous and is used when the transformation returns another Mono<T>.


### 3. then() 
    is used to sequence actions in a reactive flow. Specifically, it allows you to run one Mono after another, but instead of emitting the result of the first Mono, 
    it only emits the result of the second Mono. Essentially, it’s a way to ignore the result of one operation and move on to another

    What Does then() Do?
        Chaining Operations: The then() operator allows you to execute a Mono and then, once that Mono completes successfully (or fails), proceed to another Mono. The result of the first Mono is discarded, and only the result of the second Mono is emitted.
        Completion Signal: It’s particularly useful when you want to perform an action after another has completed, but you don’t care about the result of the first action—just that it completed.


    Why Use then()?
        Ignoring Intermediate Results: Use then() when you want to execute a second operation after a first one completes, but you don’t need the result of the first operation.
        Chaining Side Effects: It’s useful for chaining side effects where the main focus is on ensuring that one operation completes before another starts.
        Sequential Execution: then() ensures that the operations happen in sequence—first, the Mono on which then() is called, and then the Mono passed as a parameter to then().


    Example

    Suppose you have two Mono operations:
        saveToDatabase(): Saves data to a database and returns a Mono<Void> indicating completion.
        sendConfirmationEmail(): Sends a confirmation email and returns a Mono<Void>.
    You want to send the confirmation email only after the data has been successfully saved to the database, and you don’t need to handle the result of the database save operation.

    Mono<Void> operation = saveToDatabase().then(sendConfirmationEmail());

    How It Works
        First Mono: saveToDatabase() runs first. It returns a Mono<Void>, which completes when the save operation is done.
        then(): After saveToDatabase() completes, the then() operator kicks in and triggers the sendConfirmationEmail() operation.
        Emission: The resulting Mono<Void> from then() emits only when sendConfirmationEmail() completes. The result of saveToDatabase() is ignored.


    operation.subscribe(
        unused -> System.out.println("This won't print because Mono<Void> doesn't emit items"),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed: Email sent after saving to database")
    );


    Key Points
        Discarding the Result: The result of the first Mono is discarded, and only the result of the Mono passed to then() is emitted.
        Sequential Execution: It enforces sequential execution, ensuring that the second operation runs only after the first has completed.
        Common Usage: then() is commonly used when the first operation is a side effect (like saving data or logging) and the subsequent operation is what you’re interested in.

    Comparison with flatMap()
        flatMap(): Transforms the item emitted by the first Mono into another Mono, and emits the result of the second Mono. It allows you to use the result of the first Mono in the transformation.
        then(): Ignores the result of the first Mono and just moves on to the next Mono, emitting the result of the second Mono


### 4. transform() 
        is a versatile and powerful operator that allows you to apply a transformation function to the entire Mono pipeline. This operator is useful when you want to encapsulate
        a common sequence of operators or logic into a reusable function, which can then be applied to different Mono instances.

        What Does transform() Do?
            Pipeline Transformation: The transform() operator takes a function as an argument. This function receives the Mono as its input and returns another Mono. The function can apply any series of operations to the Mono, effectively transforming it.
            Reusability: One of the key uses of transform() is to encapsulate common transformation logic that can be reused across multiple Mono pipelines.
            Composition: transform() is particularly useful for composing complex operations into a single, reusable step, making your code more modular and easier to maintain.


        Why Use transform()?
            Encapsulating Logic: If you have a series of operations that you often apply to a Mono, you can encapsulate them into a single function and use transform() to apply that function.
            Code Reusability: Instead of repeating the same sequence of operators across different parts of your code, you can encapsulate the logic and reuse it with transform().
            Clean and Modular Code: Using transform() can help you keep your reactive pipelines clean and modular by separating transformation logic into distinct functions.


        Function<Mono<String>, Mono<String>> trimAndUppercase = mono -> 
                mono.map(String::trim)
                    .map(String::toUpperCase);

        Mono<String> originalMono = Mono.just("   hello world   ");
        Mono<String> transformedMono = originalMono.transform(trimAndUppercase);

        transformedMono.subscribe(
            value -> System.out.println("Transformed Value: " + value),
            error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
            () -> System.out.println("Completed")
        );

    
    Key Points
        Encapsulation: transform() allows you to encapsulate a series of operations into a single function, which can then be reused.
        Pipeline Modularity: It helps you create more modular and maintainable code by separating transformation logic from the rest of the reactive pipeline.
        Flexibility: You can apply any transformation to the Mono, whether it’s a simple operation like in the example above or a more complex sequence of operators


    Comparison with map() and flatMap()
        map(): Transforms the item emitted by the Mono synchronously.
        flatMap(): Transforms the item emitted by the Mono into another Mono asynchronously.
        transform(): Applies a function to the entire Mono pipeline, potentially including multiple operations and transformations.


### 5. flatMapMany()
     is used when you want to transform a Mono into a Flux. This is particularly useful when the transformation of the Mono's value needs to result in multiple elements being emitted, rather than just one.


    What Does flatMapMany() Do?
        Transform Mono to Flux: flatMapMany() takes a function that converts the value emitted by a Mono into a Publisher, typically a Flux. This function is applied to the item emitted by the Mono, and the resulting Flux is then flattened so that it emits its items directly.
        Asynchronous and Reactive: Like other flatMap variants, flatMapMany() allows for asynchronous processing. It enables the transformation of a single Mono into a sequence of items that can be emitted asynchronously.


    Why Use flatMapMany()?
        Handling Multiple Results: Use flatMapMany() when you need to transform a single value emitted by a Mono into a sequence of values, represented as a Flux.
        Complex Transformations: It’s particularly useful when the transformation requires generating multiple items, such as when querying a database or making an API call that returns multiple results.
        Composing Streams: flatMapMany() is ideal for composing more complex reactive flows where you need to move from a single item (represented by a Mono) to multiple items (represented by a Flux).


    Example
        Suppose you have a Mono<String> that emits a single user ID, and you want to fetch all the orders for that user, where each order is represented by an item in a Flux<Order>:


    Mono<String> userIdMono = Mono.just("user123");
    Flux<Order> ordersFlux = userIdMono.flatMapMany(userId -> findOrdersByUserId(userId));


    ordersFlux.subscribe(
        order -> System.out.println("Order: " + order),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );


    Key Points
        Flux from Mono: flatMapMany() is used to transform a single Mono into a Flux, allowing for multiple items to be emitted based on the value of the Mono.
        Asynchronous: It supports asynchronous operations, making it ideal for reactive streams where you need to handle multiple results that are generated asynchronously.
        Flattening: The resulting Flux from the transformation function is flattened, meaning that the items within the Flux are emitted directly, rather than wrapping the Flux itself.

    Comparison with Other Operators
        flatMap(): Transforms the item emitted by a Mono into another Mono. The result is still a Mono.
        flatMapMany(): Transforms the item emitted by a Mono into a Flux, allowing for multiple items to be emitted.
        map(): Synchronously transforms the item emitted by a Mono into another item of potentially a different type but still emits a single item.



-------------------------

### Transformation Operators for Flux

### 1. map() 
        same as the mono map operator, differences is only that work with stream of data bcz flux emit 0 or N elements.

### 2. flatMap() 
         It allows you to transform each item emitted by a Flux into another Publisher (typically a Flux or Mono), and then "flattens" the resulting publishers into a single Flux.
         This process enables you to perform asynchronous operations that might return multiple items for each original item, and combine all the results into a single, unified stream.


        What Does flatMap Do?
            Transformation to Publisher: The flatMap operator takes a function that transforms each item emitted by the source Flux into another Publisher (either Mono or Flux).
            Flattening: Once the transformation function has been applied, flatMap flattens all the Publisher results into a single Flux that emits all the items from each of the generated publishers.
            Asynchronous Execution: The function provided to flatMap can perform asynchronous operations, allowing multiple transformations to run concurrently. The results from these transformations are emitted as they become available, not necessarily in the order of the original items.


        Why Use flatMap?
            Handling Asynchronous Operations: Use flatMap when each item in a Flux needs to trigger an asynchronous operation that returns multiple results, such as fetching data from a database or calling an external service.
            Avoiding Nested Fluxes: Instead of ending up with a nested structure like Flux<Flux<T>>, flatMap allows you to handle these nested publishers more cleanly by flattening them into a single Flux.
            Concurrent Processing: flatMap allows multiple transformations to be processed concurrently, making it useful for scenarios where you need to maximize throughput and efficiency.


    Flux<Integer> userIdsFlux = Flux.just(1, 2, 3);
    Flux<Order> ordersFlux = userIdsFlux.flatMap(userId -> fetchOrdersByUserId(userId));

    ordersFlux.subscribe(
        order -> System.out.println("Order: " + order),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );



    Key Points
        Asynchronous and Concurrent: flatMap allows for concurrent execution of the transformation function, meaning multiple operations can be in progress at the same time.
        Order of Emission: The order of items emitted by the resulting Flux may not match the order of the original items because flatMap flattens the results as they become available.
        Error Handling: Errors in any of the resulting publishers are propagated down the stream, making it easy to manage and respond to exceptions.


    Comparison with map and concatMap
        map: Transforms each item synchronously into another item.
        flatMap: Transforms each item into a Publisher (often asynchronously) and flattens the results into a single Flux.
        concatMap: Similar to flatMap, but preserves the order of items by processing each item one at a time, waiting for each Publisher to complete before starting the next one.
