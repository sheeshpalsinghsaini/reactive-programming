## basic building blocks of Project Reactor and how to create reactive streams.


Project Reactor is a popular library for building reactive applications on the JVM. It provides efficient demand-driven or reactive-streams programming 
using two main building blocks: Flux and Mono. Here's a simplified explanation of these components and how you can use them to create reactive streams:

### 1. Mono
A Mono represents a reactive stream that emits either zero or one item and then completes or fails. It's useful for single-value asynchronous operations. 
For example, fetching a single row from a database or making a single HTTP request.

import reactor.core.publisher.Mono;
public class MonoExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Mono<String> monoString = Mono.just("Hello, Reactor!");
        monoString.subscribe(
            item -> System.out.println(item),
            error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
            () -> System.out.println("Completed successfully!")
        );
    }
}


In this example:

    Mono.just("Hello, Reactor!") creates a Mono that emits a single string.
    subscribe() is used to consume the stream. It prints the item, handles errors, and confirms completion.


---------------------

### 2. Flux 

A Flux represents a reactive stream that can emit zero, one, or many items. It is analogous to a collection but in an asynchronous and potentially
unbounded context. Use Flux for operations where multiple values are generated and processed asynchronously, like processing streams of data from a file or responses from a network call.



import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;
public class FluxExample {
public static void main(String[] args) {
Flux<String> fluxStrings = Flux.just("Hello", "Reactor", "World");
        fluxStrings.subscribe(
            item -> System.out.println(item),
            error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
            () -> System.out.println("Completed successfully!")
        );
    }
}


In this example:

    Flux.just("Hello", "Reactor", "World") creates a Flux that emits three strings.
    subscribe() again consumes these items individually, printing each and handling completion and errors similarly to Mono.

-------------------

### 3. Error Handling 

Handling errors in a reactive stream is crucial for building robust applications. Project Reactor provides mechanisms for this:

--
    Flux<String> fluxWithError = Flux.just("1", "2", "three", "4")
    .map(value -> {
        try {
            return Integer.parseInt(value);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Parsing error");
        }
    });

fluxWithError.subscribe(
item -> System.out.println(item),
error -> System.err.println("Caught error: " + error)
);

This handles parsing errors gracefully by logging them and continues processing other elements if configured to do so.

Project Reactor's Mono and Flux are powerful tools for handling asynchronous data streams, providing both the flexibility to handle a wide range of use
cases and the robustness needed for production-grade applications. Their rich API and comprehensive documentation make them accessible for both beginners
and experienced developers in the reactive programming world.
