## Operators and Transformations

In reactive programming, operators and transformations are tools that help you manipulate and handle streams of data in an 
efficient and expressive manner. Let’s break down these concepts to understand how they apply in reactive frameworks like RxJava, Project Reactor, or others.

### Operators 
Operators are functions that you apply to a reactive stream (like Flux or Mono in Project Reactor, or Observable in RxJava)
to perform actions such as filtering data, transforming values, combining streams, or handling errors. These operators allow 
you to build complex data processing pipelines that are executed in a non-blocking and asynchronous manner.

Operators can be categorized into several types based on what they do:

    Creation Operators: Create a stream from various sources like collections, data, events, or custom logic.
    Transformation Operators: Change items that are emitted by a stream into a different form or type.
    Filtering Operators: Emit only those items from a stream that meet a certain condition.
    Combination Operators: Combine multiple streams into a single stream.
    Error Handling Operators: Handle errors that occur within a stream.
    Utility Operators: Provide useful utilities like logging or delaying emissions.

### Transformations

Transformations refer specifically to operators that modify the items emitted by a stream. These operators take each input item, perform a function on it,
and emit the result as an output item. The transformation does not change the number of items in the stream (though some items can be filtered out if that's
part of the transformation).


--------------------

### Creation Operators

Creation operators in reactive programming are special functions used to create a reactive stream from various data sources. These operators are the starting point
for building a reactive chain, providing the initial source of data that will be processed, transformed, filtered, and consumed. Here, I'll explain a few common 
creation operators found in reactive programming libraries like RxJava and Project Reactor, along with examples to illustrate how to use them.

### Creation Operator for Mono

### 1. Mono.just ()
        Creates a Mono that emits a single item and then completes.
        Mono<String> monoJust = Mono.just("Hello");

### 2. Mono.empty() 
        Creates a Mono that completes without emitting any items.
        Mono<Void> monoEmpty = Mono.empty();
### 3. Mono.fromCallable()

        A Callable is a functional interface in Java that represents a task that can be executed, and it returns a result (or throws an exception)

        Mono.fromCallable() creates a Mono from a function (specifically, a Callable function) that returns a value. This function will only be executed
        when someone subscribes to the Mono, and the result of the function will be emitted as the Mono's value. It's a way to wrap a function in a reactive,
        non-blocking manner.

        public String fetchCurrentTime() {
            return java.time.LocalTime.now().toString();
        }
        
        Mono<String> timeMono = Mono.fromCallable(() -> fetchCurrentTime()); // create mono from function.




        
### 4. Mono.fromSupplier()

    Mono.fromSupplier() is similar to Mono.fromCallable()
    A Supplier is a functional interface in Java that represents a function that takes no arguments and returns a result. Unlike Callable,
    it doesn't throw checked exceptions.

    public String fetchCurrentTime() {
        return java.time.LocalTime.now().toString();
    }

    Mono<String> timeMono = Mono.fromSupplier(() -> fetchCurrentTime());
    timeMono.subscribe(time -> System.out.println("Current Time: " + time));

Key Difference from Mono.fromCallable()

    Supplier vs. Callable: A Supplier does not throw checked exceptions, while a Callable can. If your function might throw a checked exception,
    you'd use Mono.fromCallable(). If it doesn't, Mono.fromSupplier() is simpler and more appropriate.



### 5. Mono.fromFuture()
    
    What is CompletableFuture?
        A CompletableFuture is a class in Java that represents a future result of an asynchronous computation. It provides methods to handle the result 
        of the computation when it completes, either successfully or with an exception.

    Mono.fromFuture(), create mono from CompletableFuture.

    public CompletableFuture<String> fetchCurrentTimeAsync() {
         return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> java.time.LocalTime.now().toString());
    }

    Mono<String> timeMono = Mono.fromFuture(fetchCurrentTimeAsync());

    timeMono.subscribe(
         time -> System.out.println("Current Time: " + time),
         error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error)
        );


### 6. Mono.error() 

    "In Mono.error(), we create a Mono that represents a failure by immediately emitting an error, which can then be handled in the reactive stream."

        Mono<String> errorMono = Mono.error(new RuntimeException("Error!"));

### 7. Mono.delay() 

    "In Mono.delay(), we create a Mono that emits a value after a specified delay, allowing us to introduce timed pauses in a reactive stream."

Why Use Mono.delay()?

    Introduce a Delay: You might use Mono.delay() when you need to delay an operation in your reactive pipeline. For example, you could use it to simulate a timeout or to wait for a specific period before proceeding.
    Polling: In some cases, you might want to poll a resource at regular intervals. Mono.delay() can be used in combination with other reactive operators to achieve this.
    Scheduling: If you need to schedule a task to run after a certain time, Mono.delay() is a straightforward way to introduce this delay within your reactive stream.


    Mono<Long> delayedMono = Mono.delay(Duration.ofSeconds(2));
    delayedMono.subscribe(time -> System.out.println("Delayed emission after 2 seconds: " + time));

Chaining with Other Operations

    Mono.delay(Duration.ofSeconds(3))
    .then(Mono.just("Task completed after delay"))
    .subscribe(message -> System.out.println(message));

// output: Task completed after delay

### 8. Mono.never() 

    In Mono.never(), we create a Mono that remains idle indefinitely, never emitting any value or completing."

    Why Use Mono.never()?
        Testing: You might use Mono.never() in testing scenarios to simulate an infinite wait or to test how your application handles an unresponsive component.
        Timeout Handling: Mono.never() can be used in combination with timeout operators to simulate a case where a stream does not produce any data, forcing the timeout to trigger.
        Waiting for External Events: In some cases, you might want to create a stream that waits indefinitely until some external condition or event occurs. Mono.never() is a straightforward way to achieve this, though you'd typically combine it with other mechanisms to eventually trigger a response.



------------------------ 
### Creation Operator for Flux 

### 1. Flux.just()

    Emits a specified set of items and then completes.
    "In Flux.just(), we create a Flux that emits one or more specified values sequentially and then completes."
    Flux.just() takes one or more arguments and creates a Flux that emits these values sequentially. After emitting all the values, the Flux completes.

    Flux<Integer> numberFlux = Flux.just(1, 2, 3);
         numberFlux.subscribe(
         number -> System.out.println("Received: " + number),
         error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
         () -> System.out.println("Completed")
        );

    Comparison with Mono.just()
        Mono.just() is used when you want to emit exactly one item.
        Flux.just() is used when you want to emit one or more items.






### 2. Flux.fromIterable()

    reates a Flux from an Iterable source. An Iterable is a collection of elements that can be iterated over,
    such as a List, Set, or any other type that implements the Iterable interface.


    Why Use Flux.fromIterable()?
        Working with Collections: If you have a collection of items (like a List or Set), Flux.fromIterable() is a straightforward way to convert that collection into a Flux so that you can process the items reactively.
        Data Emission: It’s useful when you want to emit a sequence of items that are already stored in a collection, allowing you to integrate existing data sources into a reactive stream.
        Processing Large Collections: Flux.fromIterable() is ideal when you want to process items from a collection in a non-blocking, asynchronous manner.

    List<String> words = Arrays.asList("Hello", "Reactive", "World");
    Flux<String> wordFlux = Flux.fromIterable(words);

    wordFlux.subscribe(
         word -> System.out.println("Received: " + word),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
         () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );



    Comparison with Flux.just()
        Flux.just() is used to create a Flux from a fixed set of items provided directly in the method call.
        Flux.fromIterable() is used to create a Flux from a collection or any Iterable, allowing you to work with existing data structures.



### 3. Flux.fromArray()

    creates a Flux from an array. It’s similar to Flux.fromIterable(), but specifically designed to work with arrays.

    What does Flux.fromArray() do?
        Flux.fromArray() takes an array as an argument and creates a Flux that emits each element of the array sequentially. After emitting all elements, the Flux completes.


    Why Use Flux.fromArray()?
        Working with Arrays: If you have an array of items and you want to process them reactively, Flux.fromArray() is the method to use. It allows you to convert the array into a Flux so that you can handle the items in a non-blocking, reactive manner.
        Data Emission: It’s useful for emitting a sequence of items that are already stored in an array, enabling you to easily integrate existing arrays into a reactive stream.
        Processing Multiple Items: Flux.fromArray() is ideal when you need to process each item in an array reactively, especially if you want to leverage the benefits of reactive programming for handling sequences of data.


    Integer[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    Flux<Integer> numberFlux = Flux.fromArray(numbers);

    numberFlux.subscribe(
        number -> System.out.println("Received: " + number),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );

    Comparison with Flux.just()
        Flux.just() can be used to create a Flux from a few specific items directly provided in the method call.
        Flux.fromArray() is used when you already have an array and want to create a Flux from all its elements.


### 4. Flux.range() 
    creates a Flux that emits a sequence of integers within a specified range. This method is useful when you need to generate a series of numbers in a reactive stream.

    What does Flux.range() do?
        Flux.range() takes two arguments:
            start: The starting value of the range (inclusive).
            count: The number of sequential values to emit.


    Flux<Integer> rangeFlux = Flux.range(1, 5);
    
    rangeFlux.subscribe(
         number -> System.out.println("Received: " + number),
         error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
         () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );


    Comparison with Other Methods
        Flux.just(): Use Flux.just() when you have a specific set of values to emit.
        Flux.fromIterable(): Use Flux.fromIterable() when you have a collection of values.
        Flux.range(): Use Flux.range() when you want to generate a sequence of integers automatically.


### 5. Flux.empty()

    reates a Flux that completes immediately without emitting any items. It represents an empty sequence in a reactive stream.
    
    What does Flux.empty() do?
        Flux.empty() creates a Flux that does not emit any elements. When someone subscribes to this Flux, it simply completes immediately 
        without producing any data or triggering any errors.


    Why Use Flux.empty()?
        Default or Fallback Values: You might use Flux.empty() as a fallback in cases where no data is available or when a certain condition results in an empty stream.
        Testing: It’s useful in testing scenarios where you want to simulate an empty sequence or ensure that your reactive pipeline behaves correctly when no data is present.
        Composing Streams: When composing reactive streams, you might need to represent an empty stream that doesn't do anything, but still completes successfully. Flux.empty() is perfect for this.
        Conditional Emission: In situations where you conditionally decide not to emit any data, you can return Flux.empty() to signal that no items will be produced.

    Flux<String> emptyFlux = Flux.empty();
        emptyFlux.subscribe(
        item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );

    Comparison with Other Methods
        Flux.just(): Emits one or more specific items.
        Flux.fromIterable(): Emits items from a collection.
        Flux.never(): Never emits or completes, representing an infinite idle state.
        Flux.empty(): Completes immediately without emitting any items.

### 6. Flux.error()
        creates a Flux that immediately signals an error when subscribed to. This Flux does not emit any items; instead, it immediately triggers an error signal, 
        allowing you to represent a failure or exceptional condition in a reactive stream.

    What does Flux.error() do?
        Flux.error() takes an exception (or a Throwable) as an argument and creates a Flux that emits that error immediately upon subscription. When someone subscribes to this Flux, it triggers the error signal, and the error is propagated downstream.


    Why Use Flux.error()?
        Representing Failures: You might use Flux.error() to represent a failure or an exceptional condition in your reactive stream. This is useful when you want to signal that something has gone wrong and no valid data can be emitted.
        Testing: Flux.error() is often used in testing scenarios to simulate error conditions and ensure that your error-handling logic works as expected.
        Error Propagation: When composing reactive streams, you might encounter situations where an error should be propagated downstream. Flux.error() allows you to do this explicitly.
        Conditional Error Emission: If certain conditions in your application logic should result in an error, you can use Flux.error() to signal that error in a controlled manner.



    Flux<String> errorFlux = Flux.error(new RuntimeException("Something went wrong!"));
        errorFlux.subscribe(
        item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error.getMessage()),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );


    Comparison with Other Methods
        Flux.just(): Emits one or more specific items.
        Flux.empty(): Completes immediately without emitting any items.
        Flux.never(): Never emits or completes, representing an infinite idle state.
        Flux.error(): Signals an error immediately, without emitting any items.


### 7. Flux.never()

    creates a Flux that never emits any items, never completes, and never signals an error. Essentially, it represents an infinite, idle state in a reactive stream.

    What does Flux.never() do?
        Flux.never() creates a Flux that does nothing—it doesn’t emit any elements, it doesn’t complete, and it doesn’t produce any errors. When you subscribe to a Flux.never(), the subscription remains open indefinitely without any events occurring.

    Flux<String> neverFlux = Flux.never();
    neverFlux.subscribe(
        item -> System.out.println("Received: " + item),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );


    Comparison with Other Methods
        Flux.just(): Emits one or more specific items.
        Flux.empty(): Completes immediately without emitting any items.
        Flux.error(): Signals an error immediately without emitting any items.
        Flux.never(): Never emits, completes, or errors, representing an infinite, idle state.



### 8. Flux.interval()

    creates a Flux that emits a sequence of increasing long values at regular time intervals. This can be useful for tasks that need to be repeated periodically or for creating time-based streams.

    What does Flux.interval() do?
        Flux.interval() generates a Flux<Long> that emits values starting from 0 and increases by 1 at each time interval.
        The emission continues indefinitely until the subscription is canceled or the program terminates.

    Key Parameters
        Initial Delay: You can specify an initial delay before the first emission occurs.
        Period: You can specify the time period between consecutive emissions.


    Why Use Flux.interval()?
        Periodic Tasks: Flux.interval() is useful for executing tasks at regular intervals, such as polling a resource or sending heartbeat signals.
        Time-based Streams: It's ideal for creating time-based streams where events need to occur periodically.
        Simulating Intervals: In testing or simulations, Flux.interval() can help simulate the passing of time or the periodic occurrence of events.



    Let’s say you want to create a Flux that emits a value every second:
    
    Flux<Long> intervalFlux = Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(1));
    intervalFlux.subscribe(
        value -> System.out.println("Received: " + value),
        error -> System.err.println("Error: " + error),
        () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    );

    When you subscribe to intervalFlux, it will output something like this (with each value being emitted every second):

    Received: 0
    Received: 1
    Received: 2
    Received: 3
    ...


    Key Points
        Increasing Values: The Flux emits values starting from 0 and increments by 1 for each subsequent emission.
        Periodic Emission: The interval between emissions is specified by the duration you provide, making this method suitable for periodic tasks.
        Indefinite Execution: Flux.interval() runs indefinitely, meaning it will keep emitting values until the subscription is canceled or the program ends.


    Customizing the Interval    
        You can also specify an initial delay before the first emission:
        Flux<Long> intervalFlux = Flux.interval(Duration.ofSeconds(2), Duration.ofSeconds(1));

    In this case, the first value will be emitted after 2 seconds, and subsequent values will be emitted every 1 second.
